## Features

This application provides a complete workflow for AI image generation and management.

### üé® Core Image Generation
* **Prompt-Based Creation:** A central input field allows users to describe any image they want to create using natural language.
* **Image Grid Display:** Generates a grid of 9 images from a single prompt, offering multiple options at once.
* **Loading & Error States:** The interface provides clear feedback, showing loading skeletons while images are generating and a placeholder card if an image fails to load.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Advanced Generation Controls
* **Model Selection:** Users can choose from a dropdown list of different AI models to experiment with various artistic styles.
* **Seed Control:** A "Seed" input field allows for reproducible results. If a seed is provided, it will generate 9 identical images. If left empty, it will generate 9 random images.
* **Custom Dimensions:** Users can set the precise width and height for the output images.
* **Aspect Ratio Presets:** For convenience, users can click presets like `1:1`, `16:9`, `4:3`, and `3:2` to automatically set the dimensions.
* **Watermark Toggle:** A switch allows the user to remove the default logo/watermark from the generated images.

### üñºÔ∏è Personalization & History
* **Image Modal:** Any generated image can be clicked to open a detailed modal view, which displays the full image along with its metadata (prompt, model, seed, and dimensions).
* **Direct Download:** Each image card has a button to download the final `.png` file.
* **Favourites System:** Users can mark any image as a "favourite." A dedicated "Favourites" page displays all saved images, creating a personal gallery.
* **Downloads History:** The app keeps a record of every downloaded image, which can be viewed on the "Downloads" page.
* **Prompt History:** The application automatically saves recent prompts. This history is searchable and allows users to instantly reuse a previous prompt.
* **Local Persistence:** All user data (Favourites, Downloads, Prompt History) is saved in the browser's `localStorage`, so their collections and settings persist between sessions.

## Technology Stack

This project is built exclusively with frontend technologies and relies on the Pollinations AI service for image generation.

* **React.js:** A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
* **Tailwind CSS:** A utility-first CSS framework for rapid UI development.
* **React Hooks & Context API:** For state management and side effects without external libraries.
* **React Hot Toast:** For displaying notifications to the user.
* **Pollinations AI:** Used as the backend service for generating images.
