Features
This application provides a complete workflow for AI image generation and management.

üé® Core Image Generation
Prompt-Based Creation: A central input field allows users to describe any image they want to create using natural language.
Image Grid Display: Generates a grid of 9 images from a single prompt, offering multiple options at once.
Loading & Error States: The interface provides clear feedback, showing loading skeletons while images are generating and a placeholder card if an image fails to load.


‚öôÔ∏è Advanced Generation Controls
Model Selection: Users can choose from a dropdown list of different AI models to experiment with various artistic styles.
Seed Control: A "Seed" input field allows for reproducible results. If a seed is provided, it will generate 9 identical images. If left empty, it will generate 9 random images.
Custom Dimensions: Users can set the precise width and height for the output images.
Aspect Ratio Presets: For convenience, users can click presets like 1:1, 16:9, 4:3, and 3:2 to automatically set the dimensions.
Watermark Toggle: A switch allows the user to remove the default logo/watermark from the generated images.


üñºÔ∏è Personalization & History
Image Modal: Any generated image can be clicked to open a detailed modal view, which displays the full image along with its metadata (prompt, model, seed, and dimensions).
Direct Download: Each image card has a button to download the final .png file.
Favourites System: Users can mark any image as a "favourite." A dedicated "Favourites" page displays all saved images, creating a personal gallery.
Downloads History: The app keeps a record of every downloaded image, which can be viewed on the "Downloads" page.
Prompt History: The application automatically saves recent prompts. This history is searchable and allows users to instantly reuse a previous prompt.
Local Persistence: All user data (Favourites, Downloads, Prompt History) is saved in the browser's localStorage, so their collections and settings persist between sessions.


Technology Stack
This project is built exclusively with frontend technologies and relies on the Pollinations AI service for image generation.

React.js: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
Tailwind CSS: A utility-first CSS framework for rapid UI development.
React Hooks & Context API: For state management and side effects without external libraries.
React Hot Toast: For displaying notifications to the user.
Pollinations AI: Used as the backend service for generating images.
